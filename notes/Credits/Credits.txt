HarmonyGMS uses a stripped-down version of the Sonic Studio Engine template, and features various modifications from VectorSatyr's other templates.
It also uses the angle detection method from the Harmony Framework.

The Cluster Framework implements several open source libraries such as easings.gml, Input, as well as using snippets of STANNcam.
